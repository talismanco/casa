This is the setup that the [Talisman](https://github.com/talismanco) team uses to maintain identical build / development environments. The installation process is very
simple and allows for anyone to bootstrap a new development environment on any new machine in a matter of
seconds. The following is run on a pristine Ubuntu machine with `git`, `curl` and `make`
available:

```shell
  # clone the latest from master
  git clone git@github.com:talismanco/casa.git
  # run the initialization script
  make init
```

This will bootstrap `Nix` and `home-manager`, and install the respective profile for your operating system. **_Casa_** will be available in all subsequent shells, including the
customizations (vim with my favorite plugins, tmux with my customized
configuration, etc).

## How-To

Updating local instance after making a change:

```shell
$ home-manager switch
```

Listing the currently installed packages:

```shell
$ home-manager packages
```

Listing the previous and current configurations:

```shell
$ home-manager generations
```

Deleting old configurations by ID:

```shell
$ home-manager remove-generations [3 | 3 4 9]
```

Deleting old configurations by timestamps:

```shell
$ home-manager expire-generations [-30 days | 2018-01-01]
```
